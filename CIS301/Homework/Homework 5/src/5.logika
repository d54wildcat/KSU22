Translate the following to predicate logic using the following predicates:

K(x): person x is a kid
Ad(x): person x is an adult
B(x): person x rides a bike

Bob and Alice are particular individuals (so you can plug in "Bob" and "Alice" as a person in a predicate
    without using a quantifier)


1. Bob is a kid and Alice is an adult.

E x K("Bob") ^ Ad("Alice")


2. Not all kids can ride bikes.

!(âˆ€ x K(x) -> B(x))



3. There is an adult who can ride a bike.

E x (Ad(x) ^ B(x))


4. No kid is an adult.

!(E x (P(x) ^ Q(x)))
