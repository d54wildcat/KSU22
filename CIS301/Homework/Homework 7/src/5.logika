Prove, using mathematical induction, that the number n^2 + 5n + 1 is odd for any integer n >= 1.
Base case = 1       so 1^2 + 5 + 1 = 7 so base case holds

Induction step: For all numbers 1 + 2 + 3... n + 1 = (n + 1)^2 + 5(n + 1) + 1
= (n + 1)^2 + 5(n + 1) + 1 - (n + 1)
= n^2 + 2n + 1 + 5n + 1 - (n + 1)
=n^2 + 5n + 1
